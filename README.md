## The challenge

This challenge was to build an article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I could use any tools i prefer to complete the challenge. So i used this oportunity to test my sass skills and im pretty much happy with the result. I still think i need some refactoring.

The challenge just require a little bit of javascript to show the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

### Goals
The users should be able to:

[x] View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.

[x] See the social media share links when they click the share icon.
