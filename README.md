# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component

![Design preview for the Article preview component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking my approach in this front-end coding challenge. I'm not completely happy with the code, i still want to refactor it.

This challenge is completely free. If you want to try you can find it and other challenges on:

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript you'll need for this challenge is to initiate the share options when someone clicks the share icon.

The users should be able to:

[x] View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
[x] See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## Giving feedback

Feedback is always welcome, if you find any problem please report it to me.
